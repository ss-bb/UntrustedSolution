// EDIT : for fun i tried to remake level with new solution. 

// I just saw that the old one was not available any more. (they may have correct the remove empty from inventory xD )

// well , an other solution which look like a SQL injection in real life.

<SOLUTION>

player.removeItem('  phone');map.placeObject(25,10,'phone   ');

<SOLUTION>


// this one is more "complicated"

//i was going to remove my computer from my inventory instead of greenKey 
//when i realise that i have nothing in twice in my inventory, 
// in fact, i have just nothing in this inventory , it's just like.... empty... O.o , wait . :)"

//may no work now. (may is a joke, it just don't )
<SOLUTION>

if (player.hasItem('greenKey')) {
  player.removeItem('empty');
  
<SOLUTION>





SPOIL
