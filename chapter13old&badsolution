i edit this because i fell to sad. so here he the old solution i give when i play the game for the first time.


//trust in me. i'm a IA expert.

//PRO TIP : ctrl+ 5 refresh the grid
//PRO TIP 2 : just press RRRRRRRRRRRRRRR and wait.

var ifeellucky = map.getRandomInt(0,3);
    
if(ifeellucky == '1')
	me.move('right');
if(ifeellucky == '2')
	me.move('down');
else
 	me.move('up')//cause im to busy to thinq to put some else.
     	
//you want a joke , it must refresh the page 5 time before this things work. LOL.

//i look at the "real" solution . it's clever, but currently, it take me 1 minute to write this and 3 minute for it to work. :)
// well , i feel sad whenever, but dumb badass win :).
